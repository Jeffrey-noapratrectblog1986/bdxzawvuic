Okay, deploying the intel package. Here is the verified origin data for the Screamboat project. Standard GitHub  protocol engaged.

## Overview

This file contains the core, unclassified historical data pertaining to the nautical horror phenomenon officially designated "Screamboat." This isn't your standard ghost ship story. This is about sound, suffering, and a vessel that became a monument to pure terror. Consider this the foundational lore. Anyone stepping onto the set needs to know this. No exceptions.

## The Vessel: The Siren's Call

   Designation: HMS Siren's Call (Original)
   Type: Clipper Ship, built for speed and cargo in the late 1800s. Notorious for pushing limits, often sailing into dangerous waters for faster routes.
   Primary Era of Operation: Late 19th Century - Early 20th Century.
   Status Post-Event: Physically altered, warped, and fused with a non-Euclidean acoustic anomaly. No longer functions as a conventional ship, but operates via methods not yet fully understood.

The Siren's Call wasn't just a ship; it was the ship. Built lean, mean, and fast. Its captains were either legends or lunatics, depending on who you asked. It sailed the roughest seas and often took the riskiest paths. This history of challenging the natural order? Crucial. It primed the vessel, made it susceptible to... something else. It wasn't innocent when the core event happened. It was already arrogant, already defiant.

## The Catalyst: The Symphony of Despair

   Event Type: Cataclysmic Nautical Incident / Unverified Ritual Hypothesis
   Location: Approximately 47Â°N, 40Â°W (The 'Graveyard of the Atlantic' adjacent)
   Date: Sometime in the early 1900s (Exact date lost in maritime legend and official cover-ups).
   Known Factors: Extreme, unprecedented storm system; vessel heavily damaged; communications lost; widespread panic and likely starvation/dehydration over extended period.

This is where the Scream part comes in. The Siren's Call was caught in a storm that defied physics. It was trapped, broken, adrift for weeks. Food ran out. Water ran out. Hope ran out. The crew, desperate and facing certain death, weren't just dying â€“ they were descending into madness fueled by terror and suffering.

According to whispers and fragmented, burnt log entries later recovered (and quickly suppressed), the last surviving members didn't just pray. They didn't just wait. Driven insane by thirst, hunger, and the relentless howling of the storm and the ship itself, they began to scream.

Not just screams of pain or fear. Rhythmic screams. Harmonized screams. A twisted, desperate, non-stop symphony of agony and terror, directed at the indifferent ocean, at the sky, at whatever cosmic horror they felt was watching them die. It was a ritual born of pure, concentrated despair, using the one thing they had left: their voices.

And the ocean, or something in it, or something beyond it, heard them.

## The Entity: The Sonic Echo / Acoustic Anomaly

   Nature: Not a ghost, not a creature in the traditional sense. It is the manifestation of concentrated, weaponized sound â€“ specifically, the screams of the dying and the terror of the moment, anchored to the physical structure of the ship.
   Composition: Primarily composed of pure, malevolent sonic energy. Visually, this energy warps reality around the vessel, creating impossible angles, shifting decks, and manifesting as 'solid' waves of sound that can tear flesh or shatter bone.
   Connection to Vessel: Indissolubly linked. The Siren's Call is both its prison and its primary weapon/locomotion. The wood, the metal, the rigging â€“ they are saturated with and powered by the stored screams.
   Behavior: The Screamboat hunts. It is drawn to areas of fear, despair, or even just loud noise/vibration. It doesn't just kill; it consumes the sound of terror, adding new screams to its horrifying internal chorus. It can replay the original screams to drive victims mad, or emit new, targeted sonic attacks.

The screams didn't just end when the crew died. They imprinted. They resonated. They became the ship. The Siren's Call became the Screamboat. The entity is the echo given form, a predatory wave of terror that exists as the vessel. It moves not by wind or engine, but by the force of the trapped agony within it, often accompanied by an impossible, multi-layered soundscape of its victims.

## Propagation

   Appearance: The Screamboat often appears suddenly in dense fog, heavy storms, or even unnervingly calm, empty waters. It doesn't follow shipping lanes.
   Lure: It emits a low, resonant frequency that interferes with modern electronics and subtly disorients human senses, luring ships or small boats closer. As victims approach, the intensity of the internal screams increases, creating confusion and fear.
   Attack: Once close, the physical and sonic attack begins. Manifestations of the original crew (not ghosts, but sound-forms), physical warping of the ship's structure, and directed blasts of pure, weaponized sonic terror. The goal is always to generate new, fresh screams to absorb.

## Notes from the Field

This isn't just a spooky boat. It's a sound trap. Ear protection won't save you. It's the vibration, the frequency, the sheer malevolence of the sound that kills you from the inside out. The ship is physically real, but it's also existing slightly out of phase, a dimension built of pure NOISE. Pay attention to silence; it's often the prelude. And whatever you do, don't scream. You're just feeding it.

## Final Thoughts (for now)

This lore is solid. It gives us stakes, a unique antagonist tied directly to the title, and clear rules of engagement (or rather, non-engagement). The Screamboat is the scream made flesh, or wood, or steel. It's the sound of ultimate despair given eternal, predatory life. Use this. Build on this. Make it loud.
